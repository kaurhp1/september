Manual handling is the act of moving or supporting a load by hand or using bodily force, such as lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or lowering. It can involve moving objects, people, or animals. 
Manual handling is a common cause of workplace injuries, including musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and repetitive strain injuries. These injuries can affect the arms, legs, and joints, and can have a long-term impact on a person's life.

The weight of the item

Any twisting, bending, stretching, or other awkward postures that may be required
